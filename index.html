					<h4>Free To Dance</h4>
					<p class="news-paragraph" >DANCE IN AMERICA presents FREE TO DANCE a three-part documentary that chronicles 
					the crucial role that African-American choreographers and dancers have played in the development 
					of modern dance as an American art form. Tracing this phenomenon against the backdrop of America's social,
					political, and cultural landscape, the series captures the struggle for artistic freedom and spotlights 
					the genius created by cultural synergy. "Without the African contribution, we would not have had American 
					dance as we know it," says author Katrina Hazard.</p>

					<h4>Free Pascal</h4>
					<p class="news-paragraph" >Free Pascal Compiler (FPC for short, and formerly known as FPK Pascal[1]) is a free Pascal and Object Pascal compiler.
					In addition to its own Object Pascal dialect, Free Pascal supports, to varying degrees, the dialects of several other compilers, 
					including those of Turbo Pascal, Delphi, and some historical Macintosh compilers. The dialect is selected on a per-unit (module) basis, 
					and more than one dialect can be used to produce a single program. A member of the write once, compile anywhere campaign, Free Pascal 
					is available for many architectures and operating systems.</p>

					<h4>NIKE Free</h4>
					<p class="news-paragraph" >Nike Free shoes are specifically designed to let your feet move more naturally and freely than traditional athletic shoes. Over time, 
					this helps make your feet stronger. But because you’ll be using some muscles in your feet more than you might be used to, it may take 
					some time for them to get used to all that freedom. To give your feet time to adapt, we recommend you transition into using your Nike 
					Free footwear gradually.As you increase the use of your Nike Frees, you may experience some muscle soreness, just like when you exercise 
					other muscles in your body.</p>

					<h4>Hands-free umbrella to help battle April showers</h4>
					<p class="news-paragraph" > The Nubrella, which resembles a bubble wrapped around the user's head and shoulders, works by strapping on a shoulder support and 
					extending a canopy around the head. Weighing just over 1kg, it costs £40 and comes in either black or see-through style. Inventor Alan Kaufman, 49, 
					from Florida, said: "The major advantage is the wearer doesn't have to carry anything when not in use as it goes behind the head like a hood.
					"The umbrella was long overdue for some innovation, now people can ride their bikes and work outdoors completely hands free while staying protected.</p>
